			<h2>The Amodo and Porsche Insurance applications aim to reduce premiums for young drivers</h2>
			<p class="description">While Rimac cars are working on the development of new Porsche vehicles, another Croatian company, Amodo, has turned to a partnership with Porsche Insurance which it is working in Austria on an application that can conscientiously reduce young insurance drivers.</p>
			<p>If you are unfamiliar with Porsche Insurance, the name actually says everything you need to know. Porsche Insurance is part of Porsche Holding specializing in vehicle financing, and operates in Croatia as Porsche Leasing and Porsche Mobiliti.</p>
			<p>It is reasonable, therefore, to be able to benefit from Amodo applications, and we have information on exactly what is being used for them as well as for users.</p>
			<p>Gorjan Agacevic, chief product officer of Amodo,says their platform enables automakers, insurers and anyone else involved in the automotive (or more specifically, mobility) industry to launch new products and services based on real-time data collected from vehicles. </p>
			<p>When it comes to working with Porsche, Amodo has been talking about this story for about two years, and Gorjan says it's pretty normal in their business.</p>
			<p>Porsche is, as you might expect, very conservative and cautious when it comes to introducing such technologies, so significant upgrades and changes need to be talked about before they see the light of day.</p>
            <p>The collaboration between Porsche Insurance and Amodo is based on a cashback model that allows young drivers to show that they are better drivers than their average generation and thus earn a return on a casco that is not cheap in Austria, as in Croatia, especially for young drivers.</p>
            <p>This is a problem that young people around the world are suffering from, and affected by some rather bizarre rules that mandate a “young driver” until some bizarre year of age. We believe that we speak for all young drivers when we say that they would like the rules to be changed when securing and be allowed to prove that we are driving normally.</p>
            <p>We believe that they think the same in Amodo, whose mobile app seeks to address just this problem. Basically, the app works by paying you a premium car with caution and safety.</p>
