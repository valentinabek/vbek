			<h2>Sale of used vehicles in Porsche Inter Jankomir salon is starting!</h2>
			<p class="description">In the company showroom at Jankomir, potential buyers are offered over 500 vehicles of all brands and categories at special prices this Friday and Saturday only.</p>
 <p>What's new is a special 3/3 (third-third-third) financing offer with literally 0% interest and no additional fees.</p>
<p>This way you can get the 2009 Audi A5 Convertible for as little as 70.000kn, or the prestigious 2013 CLS Audi for  130.000kn. </p>
<p>Particularly interesting is the already traditional bidding. The VW Golf Variant is now available with a starting price of only 1.000 kn.</p>
 <p>In parallel with the sale, there will be a promotion of Seat's first SUV model, the attractive Ateca, whose capabilities anyone will be able to try out on the prepared demo.</p>
