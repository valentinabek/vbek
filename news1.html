			<h2>Porsche Insurance Croatia introduces auto insurance in the United States</h2>
			<p class="description">Each such insurance policy is tailored to the car owner and is based on the exact number of miles traveled during the year, as well as the number of accidents and fines paid.</p>
			<p>Although 2 customers can buy two completely identical Porsche 911s, their insurance prices will most likely be different thanks to Porsche auto insurance.</p>
            <p>Using real miles and low bases, Porsche will try to disrupt the traditional insurance industry.</p>
			<p>Porsche does not require a specific type of device or smartphone app to track miles. All a Porsche auto insurance buyer needs to do is provide a photo of the number of miles driven so the company can see the mileage status.</p>
			<p>The lack of a "big brother" in the car, or a tracking device, is definitely a big plus for some drivers.</p>
            <p>Other benefits include access to genuine Porsche accident parts, damage assessors and contracted coverage. </p>
			<p>Porsche said the program would soon expand to other states, but did not name them, or say when the expansion would happen. </p>
			<p>As each policy is tailored to the individual customer, those interested will need to contact Porsche Insurance personally about the price.</p>
			<p>Every Porsche owner manufactured after 1981 is qualified for Porsche auto insurance.</p>
